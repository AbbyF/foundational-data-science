## Colours

There are multiple ways to specify colours. In the early days of the web, 
many displays were limited and this led to a list of 256 "safe colours", with
each colour having it's on [Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors). In R, 
we type

```{r}
# If you insist on US spelling colors()
colours()[1:4]
```

we get a vector of 657 named colours.

Many people will already be familiar with the RGB colour model, where __r__ed, __g__reen and __b__lue 
are combined to produce a variety of colours. If you are forced to conform to a Corporate Visual Identity, 
you probably have a list of approved rgb colours to use. 

The RGB colour model is an additive colour model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colours, red, green and blue.

The RGB framework is useful in the implementation of creating colours, but not great
at selecting colours. Instead, you should use HSV (hue - saturation - value) 
which separates luma (intensity) from chroma (colour).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV"}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/f3_hue.png")
```

> RGB has to do with implementation; HSV has to do with perception

In general, try and avoid selecting your own colour palettes. It is really easy 
to select a bad colour scheme. For example, around 7% of males from the USA are
red-green colour blind. A couple of good sites I use are

 * [Color Brewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/). See the associated R package **RColorBrewer**
 * [I Want Hue](http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/)
 

### Rules of thumb for creating graphics {-}

Here are some general rules to consider when creating graphics (partly based on partly the book by [Munzner](http://amzn.to/2v3DBJX))

1. Maximize data-to-ink ratio ([Edward Tufte](http://amzn.to/2uE78sh))

2. Beware of the lie-factor, e.g. where do the axis start and end?

3. No unjustified 3D

4. Focus + context; what do you want to show

5. Overview first, zoom & filter, details on demand

6. Don’t over engineer

7. Avoid Excel!
