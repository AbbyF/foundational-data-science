# Shock news 

  * Statistics lectures can get boring 
  
  * Oddly, combining it with programming doesn't help (much)
  
    - Lots of small tasks, breaks

# Book/Course/Lecture overview

  * Data science is a vague term. 
  
  * Everyone can agree what a vet or a plumber does
  
  * But what does a data scientist do
  
    - No Venn diagrams are allowed!

--

# 4 minute exercise

  - In the slack channel, what skills does a data scientist need
  - No fights!

# Data Science

  *  My background is in statistics and I see data science as
the logical extension of applying statistical methods to large scale data sets.

  * A computer science person, would switch that idea on it's head
    - large data sets first, analytics second. 

  * Both of us are correct _and_ also wrong
  
---

# Course aim

  * Introduction to data science from a statistical point of view
  
  * Small, interesting data sets
  
  * Small enough to be informative, but still have real world interest.

# The trouble with ~~tibbles~~ data

# Missing data

 * Most real world data sets have missing data
 
 * There are different types of missing data!
 
---

# Missing completely at random (MCAR)

  * This is the easiest to deal with. 
  
  * The data are missing independently of both observed and unobserved data. 

--

  * If I ask you  your age, and you flip a coin. 
    - If heads, you tell me the answer
    - If tails, you refuse.

---

# Missing at random (MAR)

  * Given the observed data, data are missing independently of unobserved data
  
--

  * Scottish participants are more likely to refuse a survey on soccer excellence
  
    - but it does not depend on the level of their soccer skills.

---

# Missing not at random (MNAR)

  * Missing observations related to values of unobserved data.

--

  * As a concrete example, a good predictor of whether someone survived the titanic disaster was whether or not they
  had their age recorded.

---

# Key Skills

  * Spot where potential issues lie using a combination of basic and advanced techniques
  
---

# Talking about data

 * Quantities measured in a study are called _random variables_ 
 
 * A particular outcome is called an _observation_
 
 * A collection of observations is the _data_ (or _sample_)
 
 * The collection of all possible outcomes is the _population_

---

# Example
 
  * A customer spends on our website
  
--

  * The time spent on a website is our random variable
  
  * A particular customer's time would be an observation 
  
  * If we recorded the time for every person during the day, those times would be our data, which would form a _sample_ from the population of all customers.  
  
--

  * We often use a capital letter (say $X$) to represent our random variable, 
  * and the lower case, with subscripts (e.g. $x_1$, $x_2$, $\ldots$, ), to represent observations _in a general sense_.

---

# Population 

> In general we never observe the whole population

---

# Population

  * In practice it is difficult to observe whole populations
    - Unless we are interested in a very limited population
    
  * We reality we usually observe a subset of the population
    - A _sample_
    
---

# Data types

  * _quantitative_ (numeric)
    - discrete: data moves in steps, e.g. shoe sizes
    - Continuous: take _any_ value, but accuracy may make it look discrete
  
  * _qualitative_ (non-numeric), aka ordinal or categorical
    - e.g. colours, survival
    
---

# Exercise

Identify the type of data described in each of the following examples.

  * An opinion poll was taken asking people which party they would vote for in a general election.

  * In a steel production process the temperature of the molten steel is measured and recorded every 60 seconds.

  * A market researcher stops you on the street and asks you to rate between 1 (disagree strongly) and 5 (agree strongly) 
  your response to opinions presented to you.
  
  * The hourly number of units produced by a beer bottling plant is recorded.

Also consider potential sources of error in the four scenarios


---

# Sample size

  * Larger samples will generally give more precise information about the population
    - but, quality matters!
    - Facebook users aren't representation of the population
    
  * National opinion polls often rely on samples in the region of just $1,000$
    - Carefully choosen sample
    - Need to account for the [shy tory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shy_Tory_Factor) or
    the [Bradley effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect)

# Designing the experiment

  * Designing an experiment is hard!

--
  
  * Let's suppose the two adverts were displayed on facebook. 
    - Display advert 1 followed by advert 2
    - Leads to [_confounding_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding)

--

 * Is traffic on facebook the same on each day, e.g. is Friday different from Saturday?
 * Is the week before Christmas the same as the week after Christmas?
 * Was your advert on the same page as a more popular advert?
 
---

# Randomisation

  * Display the advert with a probability. 
  * The probability could be equal,
    - Or if you were trying a new and untested approach, 
    you might have probability $0.95$ standard advert, $0.05$ new advert.
