# Shock news 

  * Statistics lectures can get boring 
  
  * Oddly, combining it with programming doesn't help (much)
  
    - Lots of small tasks
    
  * Regular, small breaks

--

  * Slides are a subset of the [lecture notes](https://github.com/jumpingrivers/foundational-data-science)
  
    - These are notes, not a polished book

# Book/Course/Lecture overview

  * Data science is a vague term
  
  * Everyone can agree what a vet or a plumber does
  
  * But what does a data scientist do
  
    - No Venn diagrams are allowed!

# Four minute exercise

  - In the slack channel, what's the difference between a
  
    - A statistician
    
    - A data scientist
    
    - A computer scientist?
    
  - No fights!

# Data Science

  *  My background is in statistics 
  
    - I see data science as the logical extension of applying statistical methods to large scale data sets

--

  * A computer science person would switch that idea on it's head
  
    - Large data sets first, analytics second

  * Both of us are correct _and_ also wrong

# Key skills

  * Spot where potential issues lie using a combination

--

   * Statistics

--

   * Programming

--

   * Visualisation

--

   * Domain specific knowledge
  
---

# Course aim

  * Introduction to data science from a statistical point of view
  
  * Small, interesting data sets
  
  * Small enough to be informative, but still have real world interest
  
--

  * Introduce some mathematical notation
  
  * We'll cover means (the average). Why do we use:
    
      * $\mu$ and $\bar x$ for the same(?) thing?

      * Simple cases to give insight in more complex examples
--

  * Allegedly interesting examples

# The trouble with ~~tibbles~~ data

> The trouble with interesting data, is that there are so many potential problems

---
`r add_border(inverse=FALSE)`

---

# Example: Missing data

 * Most real world data sets have missing data
 
 * There are different types of missing data!
 
---

# Missing completely at random (MCAR)

  * This is the easiest to handle
  
  * The data are missing independently of both observed and unobserved data 

--

  * If I ask you  your age, and you flip a coin
  
    - If heads, you tell me the answer
  
    - If tails, you refuse
    
--

  * Easy to fill in the blanks

---

# Missing at random (MAR)

  * Given the observed data, data are missing independently of unobserved data
  
--

  * People from New York are more likely to refuse to tell us their voting preferences

--

    * But it does not depend on __who__ they are voting for

--

 * National opinion polls often rely on samples in the region of just $1,000$

    - Carefully chosen sample
    
    - Need to account for the [shy tory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shy_Tory_Factor) or
    the [Bradley effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect)
 

---

# Missing not at random (MNAR)

  * Missing observations related to values of unobserved data

--

  * As a concrete example, a good predictor of whether someone survived the titanic disaster was whether or not they
  had their age recorded

---

# Talking about data

 * Quantities measured in a study are called _random variables_ 
 
 * A particular outcome is called an _observation_

--

 * A collection of observations is the _data_ (or _sample_)
 
 * The collection of all possible outcomes is the _population_

---

# Example
 
  * A customer spends on our website
  
--

  * The time spent on a website is our random variable
  
--

  * A particular customer's time would be an observation 

--

  * If we recorded the time for every person during the day, those times would be our data
    - A _sample_ from the population of all customers
  
--

  * We often use a capital letter (say $X$) to represent our random variable

--

  * A lower case, with subscripts (e.g. $x_1$, $x_2$, $\ldots$, ), to represent observations _in a general sense_.

---

# Population 

> In general we never observe the whole population

---

# Population

  * In practice it is difficult to observe whole populations
  
    - Unless we are interested in a very limited population
    
  * We reality we usually observe a subset of the population
  
    - A _sample_
    
---

# Data types

  * _quantitative_ (numeric)
  
    - Discrete: data moves in steps, e.g. shoe sizes
    
    - Continuous: take _any_ value, but accuracy may make it look discrete
--

  * _qualitative_ (non-numeric), aka ordinal or categorical

    - e.g. colours, survival

<!-- # Exercise -->

<!-- Identify the type of data described in each of the following examples. -->

<!--   * An opinion poll was taken asking people which party they would vote for in a general election -->

<!--   * In a steel production process the temperature of the molten steel is measured and recorded every 60 seconds -->

<!--   * A market researcher stops you on the street and asks you to rate between 1 (disagree strongly) and 5 (agree strongly)  -->
<!--   your response to opinions presented to you -->

<!--   * The hourly number of units produced by a beer bottling plant is recorded -->

<!-- Also consider potential sources of error in the four scenarios -->


<!-- Qualitative → Categorical -->
<!-- Quantitative → Continuous -->
<!-- Quantitative → Discrete → Ordinal -->
<!-- Quantitative → Discrete -->

---

# Sample size

  * Larger samples will generally give more precise information about the population

    - Quality matters!
    
    - Facebook users aren't representation of the population
    
    

---

# Designing the experiment

  * Designing an experiment is hard!

--
  
  * Let's suppose the two adverts were displayed on facebook. 
    - Display advert 1 followed by advert 2
    - Leads to [_confounding_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding)

--

 * Is traffic on facebook the same on each day, e.g. is Friday different from Saturday?
 
 * Is the week before Christmas the same as the week after Christmas?
 
 * Was your advert on the same page as a more popular advert?
 
---

# Randomisation

  * Display the advert with a probability
  
  * The probability could be equal
  
    - Or if you were trying a new and untested approach, you might have probability $0.95$ standard advert, $0.05$ new advert
    
--

  * Whenever possible, use simple random sampling as it makes problems disappear
  
--

  * Also interesting is the art of asking an embarrassing question

<!-- # Exercise -->

<!-- Rashid, Ellen and Hamish all work as business analysts for a leading clothing manufacturer.  The design team want to know how successful a new pair of jeans will be, and so they ask the analysts to conduct some research.   -->

<!--   *  Hamish is lazy.  He goes home that night and asks his four flatmates to give the new jeans a score from 1--5, and then reports his findings back to the design team the next day. _What sort of sampling scheme has Hamish adopted, and why might it be flawed?_ -->

<!--   * Ellen thinks she will try to collect a simple random sample of people who might wear the jeans; she will then try to elicit their opinions.  _Why might a simple random sample be difficult to obtain here?_ -->

<!--   * Rashid is more thoughtful than both Hamish and Ellen.  He thinks about the target population for the new jeans: females in the age group 21--30.  He then spends a full day walking up and down Oxford Street, stopping people he thinks fulfil this criteria and asking them to decide whether or not they would buy the new jeans. _What sort of sampling scheme has Rashid adopted?_ -->
