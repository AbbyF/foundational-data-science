# Visualisation

  * Data visualisation is an old topic; but in the last few years, it's become particularly trendy
  
  * With the correct visualisation, we can highlight key features that don't require any fancy statistics.

--

## Prerequisites (R)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "hrbrthemes"))
````
```{r, message=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
library("hrbrthemes")
```

---

`r add_border(inverse=TRUE, background_image = "assets/white_logo.png")`
---
`r add_class(middle = TRUE, center = TRUE, inverse = TRUE)`

# Historical visualisations

# John Snow (not __that__ John Snow)

John Snow (who did know something) created a simple dot map to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around a water pump 

```{r, 3-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg")
```

# Hereford Mappa Mundi (1300)

It is the largest medieval [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereford_Mappa_Mundi) known still to exist
  * At the centre of the map is Jerusalem
  * In the bottom left is the UK
  * At the top is the garden of Eden!

```{r, 3-2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "35%"}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/hereford.jpg")
```

# Florence Nightingale

[Florence Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale): a true pioneer in the graphical representation of statistics


```{r, 3-3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/Nightingale-mortality.jpg")
```

# DatasauRus

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}

# Scatter plots

  * A scatter plot has horizontal and vertical axes to plot data points
  
  * Typically they are used to show how one variables is affected by another

---

# Example: Bond

> Has Bond become more violent over time?

--

```{r}
{{ggplot(bond, aes(x = Number, y = Kills))}} + # Create a canvas
  geom_point() # Add a layer of points
```

---

# Example: Bond

> Has Bond become more violent over time?

```{r}
ggplot(bond, aes(x = Number, y = Kills)) + # Create a canvas
{{  geom_point()}} # Add a layer of points
```

---

# Example: Bond (in colour)


```{r, 3-5}
g = ggplot(bond, aes(x = Number, y = Kills)) + # Create a canvas
{{  geom_point(aes(colour = Actor))}}  # Add a layer of points
g
```

---

# Exercise

Using the beauty data set, produce some interesting plots, e.g.

  * `beauty` vs `students`

```{r, fig.keep="none"}
# Perhaps use colour?
ggplot(beauty, aes(x = age, y=students)) + 
  geom_point()
```

  * `beauty` vs `age`, coloured by `tenured`

  * Anything else?

---

# Trend lines

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
(g_smooth = g + 
   stat_smooth(colour = "steelblue", 
              se = FALSE, 
              method = "loess"))
```

---

# Insights

1. The number of kills appears to be increasing with each bond movie

2. Pierce Brosnan (the green points) liked killing people

3. Daniel Craig's movies didn't contain (that) many deaths

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
(g_smooth = g + 
   stat_smooth(colour = "steelblue", 
              se = FALSE, 
              method = "loess"))
```
---

# Styling your plot

  * **ggplot2** has the concept of themes that can style the plot

--
  
  * [hrbrthemes](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes) package

> typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2

Basically, it's opinionated

# Exercise / Q & A

  * Does alcohol consumption change through time?
```{r, fig.keep="none"}
g = ggplot(bond, aes(x = Number, y = Alcohol_Units)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = Actor))
g
```

  * Does there appear to a relationship between alcohol and the number of kills?
    
    - Add on `stat_smooth()`
    
  * Change method from `smooth` to `lm`
  
    - Add on `stat_smooth(method = "lm")`

# Histograms

  * A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of continuous, numerical data
  
  * If the area under the graph adds up to one, then it is a _probability_ distribution
  
--

  * Divide the entire range into a series of intervals and count how many values fall into each interval
  
  * Bins do not have to be the same size (but they probably should be in general)

--

  * Nice example at [Tin Lizzie](http://tinlizzie.org/histograms/)

---

# Histograms: OKCupid

```{r, fig.keep="none"}
ggplot(cupid, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) 
```

```{r 3-8,echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
g1 = ggplot(cupid, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + xlim(c(18, 110)) + 
  ggtitle("binwidth = 1")
g2 = ggplot(cupid, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + xlim(c(18, 110)) + 
  ggtitle("binwidth = 5")
g3 = ggplot(cupid, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) + xlim(c(18, 110)) + 
  ggtitle("binwidth = 10")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(g1, g2, g3, ncol=3)
```

---

# Facets

```{r, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(cupid, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  facet_wrap(~ sex) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(18, 80))
```
---

# Exercise

Generate histograms for 

  * `height`
```{r, fig.keep="none", message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(cupid, aes(x = height)) + 
  geom_histogram() 
```

  * Try different binwidths, e.g. `geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)`
  
  * Use facets to split by `sex`

---

# Insights

1. There are many more male OK Cupid users than female (not surprising)

2. The general age distribution looks similar between sexes

3. The most surprising aspect is that the spike in age 42 is due to female users
  - This could be by pure chance
  - users lying about their age
  - a mistake in data entry

---

# Density plots

>  Essentially we draw a line around the histogram.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(cupid, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_density(aes(colour = sex)) +
  xlim(c(18, 80))
```

---

# How does a kernel density plot work?


```{r, out.width="90%", echo=FALSE}
local(source("code/f3_kernel.R"))
```
---

# Boxplots

```{r, echo=FALSE}
local(source("code/f3_boxplot.R"))
```

---

# Boxplot: OKcupid

```{r,  out.width="80%"}
# Missing values are represented with a -1
ggplot(cupid, aes(x = income, y = age)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

# Barplots

> A bar chart or bar graph is a chart that presents grouped data with rectangular bars 
with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. 

---

# Barplots (Bond)

```{r}
ggplot(bond) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Actor))
```

---

# Barplots (Bond)

```{r, fig.keep="none"}
ggplot(bond) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Actor))
```

  * Typically ordering the axis alphabetically isn't best
   * We could order the either by the number of movies
   * By the date the actor first appeared.

---

# Barplots (Bond)

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", dev="svg", warning=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
library(hrbrthemes)
g1 = count(bond, Actor) %>% 
  mutate(n=n) %>% 
  arrange(n) %>%
  mutate(Actor=factor(Actor, levels=Actor)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Actor, y =n)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = "No. of Movies",
       title="The Bond data set",
       subtitle="Ordering a bar chart is a useful trick",
       caption="jumpingrivers.com") + 
  theme_ipsum(grid="X")

g1
```

---

# Summary

  * We need measures of location __and__ spread
    
    - Also be wary of just point estimates
    
  * Means and variances can be used for streaming data
  
  * Simple charts can highlight interesting features
