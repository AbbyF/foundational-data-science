## General notes so far

I have put some commented out XXX in the source in true Gillespie style so you can search for the X rated stuff. I may have missed some XXX by accident though so after looking at XXX just seach for the html comment string

### Response to XXX

  * Data loading is in chaos. In a week, I'll make it consistent. Either via a

  * Median question: doesn't matter about ascending/descending
  * I don't think the previous is true barplot(table(Beauty$beauty)) - use `hist()`
