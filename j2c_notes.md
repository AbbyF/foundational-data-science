## General notes so far

I have put some commented out XXX in the source in true Gillespie style so you can search for the X rated stuff. I may have missed some XXX by accident though so after looking at XXX just seach for the html comment string

### Response to XXX

  * Data loading is in chaos. In a week, I'll make it consistent. Either via a
  package, or CSV file
  * I've never yet seen average to mean anything other than mean. I know that's what we teach to UG, but...
  * Median question: doesn't matter about ascending/descending
  * I don't think the previous is true barplot(table(Beauty$beauty)) - use `hist()`

#### Response to response

  * Fair enough
  * Possibly true amongst non statisticians, i always imagine if darren was reading it when it comes to statistical details
  * I know, that's what I was picking you up on. You could have just said sorted into order
  * Hard to know where or why i put this now that you have removed
