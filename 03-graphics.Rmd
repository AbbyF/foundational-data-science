> A picture paints a thousand words - _Frederick R. Barnard_

Data visualisation is an old topic; but in the last few years, it's become particularly trendy.
With the correct visualisation, we can highlight key features
that don't require any fancy statistics.

#### Prerequisites {-}

We could have an entire course on creating graphics, but in this chapter we'll concentrate 
on the fundamentals. To make this section concrete, we'll use the [**ggplot2**](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
package within R. However, there are many libraries available to generate the graphics
in other languages. For example, in Javascript we could use `d3`, or `seaborn` in python.

The **ggplot2** package can be easily installed via
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
````
and loaded in the usual way
```{r message = FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
```
We'll also use the [**hrbrthemes**](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes) package for styling the graph. 
This is still developmental and can be installed using the devtools package
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes")
```

## Historical visualisations 

John Snow^[Not [that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Snow_(character)) Jon Snow, he knows nothing.] 
created a simple dot map to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around a water pump - figure \@ref(fig:3-1).
This allowed him to show the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases.
He was able to demonstrate that the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the Thames and delivering the water to home. 
Thereby leading to an increased incidence of cholera. This study is a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology.

(ref:3-1) John Snow dot map of cholera cases (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow).

```{r, 3-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "(ref:3-1)"}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg")
```

The Hereford Mappa Mundi dates from around 1300 - figure \@ref(fig:3-2). It is currently on display at Hereford Cathedral in [Hereford](https://goo.gl/maps/EQpxywNkjbB2), England. 
It is the largest medieval map known still to exist. At the centre of the map is Jerusalem,
in the bottom left is the UK, at the top is the garden of Eden (some of the data points are approximate!)

```{r, 3-2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.cap="(ref:3-2)"}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/hereford.jpg")
```

[Florence Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale) is described as "a true pioneer in the graphical representation of statistics". 
Her diagram about the causes of mortality in the army (figure \@ref(fig:3-3)), was ground breaking.
Florence's graph showed that sanitation was a major killer in the army. After 
successfully lobbying the government, the mortality rate dropped from 69 to 18 per 1000.

(ref:3-3) Diagram of the causes of mortality in the army in the East by [Florence Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale).

```{r, 3-3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.cap="(ref:3-3)"}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/Nightingale-mortality.jpg")
```

Visualisation is incredibly important. Whenever I get a data set, I automatically 
start generating plots to get a feel for the data. It helps us to detect interesting
patterns in the data; remember plotting can save lives (if you're Florence Nightingale).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap = "https://github.com/stephlocke/datasauRus"}
#knitr::include_graphics("graphics/DinoSequential.gif")
```

## Scatter plots

A scatter plot has horizontal and vertical axes to plot data points.
Typically they are used to show how one variables is affected by another. 
Let's start with a simple scatter plot of looking at whether
the Bond movies have become more violent over time. In ggplot, 
we first specify a _canvas_ and then add subsequent layers using the 
`+` operator
```{r 3-4, fig.cap = "Has Bond got more violent?"}
ggplot(bond, aes(x = Number, y = Kills)) + #Create a canvas
  geom_point() # Add a layer of points
```
On the $x$-axis we have the movie number (chronological movie order) and on 
the $y$-axis we have the number of kills made by Bond. The scatter plot
does show a general trend, with an increased number of deaths in latter movies.

Figure \@ref(fig:3-4) is OK, but could be significantly improved. 

```{block, type="rmdnote"}
There's a lot going on in the code used to generate the figure. The 
first argument is the data frame `bond`, while `aes` argument specifies what elements
in the plot should change with a variable.
```

First we'll use colour to differentiate between actors and fix the axis limits
```{r, 3-5, fig.cap = "Using colour to differentiate between actors."}
g = ggplot(bond, aes(x = Number, y = Kills)) + # Create a canvas
  geom_point(aes(colour = Actor)) + # Add a layer of points
  ylim(c(0, 50))  
g # With ggplot we can store the graph construct
```
By using colour, we can see that Pierce was a particularly violent Bond, with the green points
in the top right hand corner. 

Next we can add a trend line to get a feel for the relationship over time. 
The `stat_smooth()` layer adds a local trend line. Essentially, the line moves 
along the $x$-axis and the gradient is only affected by nearby points.
```{r, 3-6, fig.cap = "Capturing the trend.", message=FALSE}
g_smooth = g + stat_smooth(colour = "steelblue", se = FALSE, method = "smooth")
g_smooth
```
This graph now contains some useful insight.

1. The number of kills appears to be increasing with each bond movie.
2. Pierce Brosnan (the green points) liked killing people.
3. Daniel Craig's movies didn't contain (that) many deaths.


### Styling your plot

If the graph is only going to be consumed by the data scientist, then there
is no need to spend time polishing the final product. However if the graph 
is to be used to convince or highlight issues for other people, then some
time and effort needs to be spent. 

**ggplot2** has the concept of themes that can style the plot. Here we 
use the [hrbrthemes](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes) package. It provides

> typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2

Basically, it's opinionated. The package enables us to change the background colour, tweak the palette
and add proper labels, with minimal effort
```{r, 3-7, fig.cap="Pimping your graph with the hrbrthemes package.", message=FALSE, dev='png', out.width="75%", dpi=300}
library(hrbrthemes)
g_smooth + 
  theme_ipsum() + 
  scale_color_ipsum() +
  labs(x = "Movie number", 
       y = "No. of Bond Kills",
       title="Kills through time",
       subtitle = "Is there a relationship?",
       caption = "Pierce wasn't a nice man!") 
```
With little effort, we've gone from something basic - figure \@ref(fig:3-4) - to a high 
quality, publication ready figure, \@ref(fig:3-7). Unfortunately, 
we have limited time to spend on graph aesthetics.

#### Exercise / Q & A  {-}
<!-- (25 minutes) -->

  * Does alcohol consumption change through time?
  * Does there appear to a relationship between alcohol and the number of kills?
  * Change method from `smooth` to `lm`.

## Histograms

A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of continuous, numerical data.
If the area under the graph adds up to one, then it is a _probability_ distribution.
Constructing a histogram is straightforward; we divide the entire range into
a series of intervals and count how many values fall into each interval.
Bins do not have to be the same size (but they probably should be in general).

We'll start with a histogram of users ages from the OKCupid dataset. To 
create a histogram, we use the `geom_histogram()` function 
```{r, fig.keep="none"}
ggplot(cupid, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) 
```
This creates the left plot in figure \@ref(fig:3-8).

```{r 3-8,echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Age distribution of the OKCupid data set.", out.width="80%"}
g1 = ggplot(cupid, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + xlim(c(18, 120)) + 
  ggtitle("binwidth = 1")
g2 = ggplot(cupid, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + xlim(c(18, 120)) + 
  ggtitle("binwidth = 5")
g3 = ggplot(cupid, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) + xlim(c(18, 120)) + 
  ggtitle("binwidth = 10")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(g1, g2, g3, ncol=3)
```
Notice in the code we've specified `binwidth = 1`. This means that the binwidth is equal
1 year. The default (in ggplot2) is to create a plot using 30 bins, it's always a good
idea to explore the effect of varying the binwidth. In particular, if you look carefully
at the plot where the `binwidth = 1`, we can see a spike at `age = 42`.
Another interesting feature is the long tail - this is an example of a _right skewed_ or _positively skewed_ data set.

Often we want to split a plot up by different variables, for example, the 
users `gender`. This is easy with **ggplot2**; we just add on an 
additional call to `facet_wrap()`

```{r, 3-9, fig.cap="OKCupid age distribution by gender.", out.width="70%"}
ggplot(cupid, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  facet_wrap(~ sex) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(18, 80))
```

By splitting age by gender, two interesting features become apparent from figure \@ref(fig:3-9)

1. There are many more male OK Cupid users than female (not surprising).
2. The general age distribution looks similar between sexes.
3. The most surprising aspect is that the spike in age 42 is due to female users. This
could be by pure chance, users lying about their age, or a mistake in data entry.

## Density plots

A downside of using a histogram, is that putting two histograms on top of each other
makes the graphic cluttered and unclear (of course you can use panels as above). 
An alternative method is to use a _kernel density estimator_. Essentially we draw a 
line around the histogram.


```{r, 3-10, fig.cap="Kernel density plots of the ages.", message = FALSE}
ggplot(cupid, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_density(aes(colour = sex)) +
  xlim(c(18, 80))
```
Since the distributions are represented as lines, we can plot multiple 
distributions on top of each other. By plotting in this way, it becomes
obvious the distributions of each gender are similar. _However_, we have
smoothed over the bump at age 42.


### Detailed explanation

This section aims to give gentle introduction to how kernel density plots
are actually constructed. Behind the scenes, there's some nice mathematical 
theory the underpins this graph. However, we'll avoid the maths and concentrate
on the intuition. 

Suppose we have three points: -2, -1, 2. These are shown in figure \@ref(fig:3-11) (a) as blue crosses. 
Around each point we draw a _kernel_ - figure \@ref(fig:3-11) (b). The kernel can be any non-negative (but typically
symmetric) function that integrates to one. For example, it could be a

 * rectangle;
 * triangle;
 * Gaussian (or Normal) density;
 * [Epanechnikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics)#Kernel_functions_in_common_use) function.
 
In this example, we'll use the most common kernel, a Gaussian or bell shaped curve. Next
we combine the kernels around each point into a single common curve (figure  \@ref(fig:3-11) c). Finally, 
we normalise the area under the kernel to be $1$. 

```{r, 3-11, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="How to construct a kernel density estimate.", out.width="70%"}
local(source("code/f3_kernel.R"))
```

The tricky mathematical part deals with what kernel we should use and how wide that
kernel should be. A wide kernel has the effect of flattening out our histogram shape, similar to having fewer bins. A narrow kernel has the opposite effect. Intuitively, when we have many points, the kernel should be narrower. 


## Boxplots

A box and whisker plot, sometimes simply called a boxplot, is another way to
represent continuous data. This kind of plot is particularly useful for
comparing two or more groups, by placing the boxplots side-by side. 

The central bar in the "box" is the sample _median_. The top and bottom
of the box represent the upper and lower sample _quartiles_. Just as the
median represents the 50% point of the data, the lower and upper quartiles
represent the 25% and 75% points respectively.

```{r, 3-12, fig.cap="Boxplot description."}
local(source("code/f3_boxplot.R"))
```

The lower whisker is drawn from the lower end of the box to the smallest value
that is no smaller than 1.5IQR below the lower quartile. Similarly, the upper
whisker is drawn from the middle of the upper end of the box to the largest
value that is no larger than 1.5IQR above the upper quantile. Points outside the
whiskers are classified as outliers.

If we wanted to compared how age varies by income level^[Income level is discrete in this dataset]
then a boxplot is perfect
```{r, 3-13, fig.cap = "Income by age of the OKCupid data set.", out.width="70%"}
# Missing values are represented with a -1
ggplot(cupid, aes(x = income, y = age)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
The figure highlights a gradual increase of income with age. However, for extreme
incomes it drops. I suspect this pattern is particular to San Francisco!

## Barplots

A bar chart or bar graph is a chart that presents grouped data with rectangular bars 
with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. 
The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally.

Let's look again at the bond dataset. To determine the number movies by each star we
use `geom_bar()`
```{r}
ggplot(bond) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Actor))
```

Typically ordering the axis alphabetically isn't best. In this case, we could order
the either by the number of movies, or by the date the actor first appeared.
Again with a few minor tweaks we can go from a plot that is OK, to a plot that
is informative and attractive.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%", dev="png"}
library("dplyr")
library(hrbrthemes)
g1 = count(bond, Actor) %>% 
  mutate(n=n) %>% 
  arrange(n) %>%
  mutate(Actor=factor(Actor, levels=Actor)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Actor, y =n)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = "No. of Movies",
       title="The Bond data set",
       subtitle="Ordering a bar chart is a useful trick",
       caption="jumpingrivers.com") + 
  theme_ipsum(grid="X")
g2 = count(bond, Actor) %>% 
  mutate(n=n) %>% 
  arrange(n) %>%
  mutate(Actor=factor(Actor,
                      levels=rev(c("Sean Connery", "George Lazenby", "Roger Moore", 
                                      "Timothy Dalton", "Pierce Brosnan", "Daniel Craig")))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Actor, y =n)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = "No. of Movies",
       title="The Bond data set",
       subtitle="Ordering by first appearance",
       caption="jumpingrivers.com") + 
  theme_ipsum(grid="X")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(g1, g2, ncol=2)
```
