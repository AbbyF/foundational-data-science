## Book overview

Data science is a vague term. While everyone can agree what a vet or a plumber does, an exact description of a data scientist is 
still elusive. My background is in statistics and I see data science as
the logical extension of applying statistical methods to large scale data sets.
However my colleague comes from a computer science background, and their take 
is switching that idea on it's head - large data sets first, analyics second. 
Both of us are correct _and_ also wrong. This explains why data scientists are 
in such demand. The problems they face are complex, challenging (and interesting) 
and require skills from multiple disciplines.

The goal of this short book is to provide an introduction into 
the wonderful world of data science from the statistical point of view. In 
a tradional statistics course^[Clearly there is some poetic licence here.], we would look at small, data sets to illustrate key concepts.
In a computing science course, we would start with a data base and move on from there. This
book straddles both camps. Data sets that are small enough to be informative, but still 
have real world interest.

### The trouble with ~~tibbles~~ data

The trouble with interesting data, is that there are so many potential problems. 
For example, most real world data sets have missing data. However, there are different types of
missing data!

  * Missing completely at random (MCAR). This is the easiest to deal with. The data
  are missing independently of both observed and unobserved data. For example, if I ask you
  your age, and you flip a coin. If heads, you tell me the answer. If tails, you refuse.
 
  * Missing at random (MAR): given the observed data, data are missing independently of unobserved data.
  Example: Scottish participants are more likely to refuse a survey on soccer excellence,
  but it does not depend on the level of their soccer skills.

  * Missing not at random (MNAR): missing observations related to values of unobserved data.
  As a concrete example, a good predictor of whether someone survived the titanic disaster was whether or not they
  had their age recorded.

The key skills with data science are often being able to spot where potential issues lie. Once
we know the problems, we can formulate a strategy for overcoming them. Fortunately, 
there are a few standard tools available to help us.

When a data scientist confronts a new data set, they have a powerful arsenal of statistical
and machine learning algorithms at their disposal. However, before tackling a new data set, 
we should always explore and try to understand the issues before throwing the machine learning
[kitchen sink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_sink_regression) at it.

This book targets people who work with data, but don't come from a mathematics
or statistics background. They know names of standard methods, but are a bit hazy on the
details. We aim to fill in some of the blanks. 

## Data sets

<!-- XXX Course or book? -->
During this course, we'll use a few different data sets to illustrate the key points. 

### The relationship between beauty and teaching

This data set is from a [study](https://doi.org/10.3386/w9853) where researchers were 
interested in whether a lecturers' attractiveness affected 
their course evaluation! This is a cleaned version of the
data set and contains the following variables:

 * evaluation: the questionnaire result
 * tenured: does the lecturer have tenure; 1 == Yes. In R, this value is continuous.
 * minority: does the lecturer come from an ethnic minority (in the USA)
 * age: the lecturers' age
 * gender: a factor: Female or Male
 * students: number of students in the class
 * beauty: each of the lecturers' pictures was rated by six undergraduate students: three women and three men. 
 
The raters were told to use a 10 (highest) to 1 rating scale, to concentrate on the [physiognomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiognomy) of the 
professor in the picture, to make their ratings independent of age, and to keep 5 in mind as an average. 
The scores were then normalised.


This data set has `r nrow(Beauty)` rows and `r ncol(Beauty)` columns.

### Bond, James Bond

This data set contains information about James bond movies. The data set contains `r nrow(bond)` movies
with the following columns:

 * `Film`: the movie name.
 * `Actor`: the actor who played James Bond (to be clear, [Sean Connery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Connery) is clearly the best bond).
 * `Kills`: the number of kills by Bond.
 * `Relationships`: the number of romantic relationships by Bond.
 * `Alcohol_Units`: the number of Units of alcohol consumed by Bond.
 * `Alcohol`: a discretised version of `Alcohol_Units`.
 * `Nationality`: the nationality of the Bond actor.

collecting this data.

### OKCupid

This data set was created using a python script to pull data from public profiles on [okcupid](www.okcupid.com). There are a total of `r nrow(cupid)` profiles which includes people within a 25 mile radius of San Francisco, who were online between June 2011 and July 2012 and had at least one profile picture. Each user has 32 variables. 
The overall data set is around 150MB, while not "big", it is prohibitive for teaching. 
So we've dropped 11 variables relating to "users essays". This results in an uncompressed data set of around 12MB.
